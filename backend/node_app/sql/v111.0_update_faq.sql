    ('What is a GAMECHANGER clone?', 'GAMECHANGER technology is scalable and can be applied to use cases other than just policy. We refer to other “versions” of GAMECHANGER that are based on a different underlying corpus as clones. To date, we have 5 clones in production that are each focused on a specific use case. Our EDA clone, as an example, allows for search and discovery on DoD contract data. Clones can be customized and include features tailored to the particular use case.', 'clones'),
    ('How do I request a clone?', 'The first step would be to fill out our Clone Request form accessible via the left-hand side menu. The form requests information about your use case including use case background, data, expected users, permissions required, and any planned features. Once we receive your completed form, the GAMECHANGER team will review your use case and initiate follow-up discussions as needed to determine feasibility and Level of Effort.', 'clones'),
    ('What best practices should I keep in mind when constructing my search queries?','<i><b>Tip 1: Start with basic keywords</i></b><br/>Start by running a simple search using keywords like <i>naval research</i>. Add other descriptive words or keywords to further narrow the results. You can also search using words or numbers that appear in the titles of documents, like <i>navy equal opportunity</i> or <i>opnavinst 5354</i>, which will bring the specific document to the top of the results.<br/><br/><b><i>Tip 2: Use suggestions in the search bar</i></b><br/>GAMECHANGER allows real time searching across titles, topics, organizations, and more to help you search effectively before you even click enter. Typing <i>5500</i> suggests titles that contain the number to help you further narrow down your query. Or type <i>joint art</i> to see suggestions such as <b>joint artificial intelligence center</b> or <b>joint artificial</b>.<br/><br/><i><b>Tip 3: Use filters in advanced or after searching on the side menu </i></b><br/>By clicking Advanced before running an initial search, users can select specific sources, types of documents, publication dates, and more to streamline results, particularly when searching generic words. For example, searching for <i>Title 10</i> with the filter <b>Titles</b>, will return the exact document. Users can also search <b>Related Terms</b> (located in the side tab), which are terms that may be similar to your query.<br/><br/><b><i>Tip 4: Use quotes</i></b></br>Putting a query in quotes will result in exact matches, meaning results will not include fragmented words or pieces of the query, but will search only and exactly on the entire query as-is. For example, a search on <i>environment protection</i> without quotes may yield results that have <b>environment</b> AND <b>protection</b> in the same paragraph, or even results that include <b>environmental protection</b>. Including quotes significantly reduces number of results provided.<br/><br/><b><i>Tip 5: Use operators</i></b></br>GAMECHANGER uses default <b>AND</b> when users include spaces between words, so whether <i>electromagnetic operations</i> or <i>electromagnetic</i> AND <i>operations</i> is searched, the application will yield the same results, all including both words in the documents provided. Users can use the operator <b>OR</b> like <i>electromagnetic OR operations</i>, which will yield results that have either one or both words. Users can also use the subtraction operator (-) to filter out words not wanted in the results. For example, <i>autonomous flight -naval</i> will remove results with the word naval in it.<b><i>Tip 6: Use intelligent search and answers</i></b></br>Many searches will yield a document or answer highlighted at the top of the results page, retrieved using AI through our Intelligent Search capability. This functionality is designed to help users more quickly identify specific documents, entities, organizations, and definitions, or even answer questions without searching through thousands of results. For example, searching <i>coast guard academy purpose</i> will yield the definition and purpose of the Coast Guard Academy; or, try asking GAMECHANGER a question, such as <i>what is the mission of army corps of engineers</i>?', 'search'),
    ('Why are there some results that do not have highlights of my search term?', 'In a small number of cases, the highlights (or snippets) are cut off from being fully displayed on the front of the card but are still contained in the document.', 'search'),
    ('Why is the prompt at the top unrelated to my search query?','The Intelligent Search uses AI to extract the most useful information from a search query. While it is not 100% accurate, we are always working to improve it. Give us feedback by choosing the thumbs up or thumbs down button to let us know whether or not the result was relevant to your search.','search'),
    ('Can I save a search with the filters I selected?','Yes; click on the star in the tool’s search bar and your search will be saved with all filters selected. Users can access this “favorited” search in the User Dashboard.', 'search'),
    ('What is the Graph View and how do I use it?', 'Built on Neo4j, the Graph View visualizes complex relationships between documents by presenting nodes on a directed graph with edges. Each node represents a different document from the search results. Each edge represents a connection between documents. These connections are determined based upon references made within documents themselves (e.g., document A references document B). The Graph View is fully interactive and can be magnified to view more details. Clicking on a node provides a set of options to explore the document further, including an icon that opens the document card.','graph view'),
    ('How do I request additional data be added to the GAMECHANGER corpus?','Reach out to us directly – either via our User Feedback form or via email @ osd.pentagon.ousd-c.mbx.advana-gamechanger@mail.mil.','data'),
    ('Where do I go to find out what policy documents are currently in GAMECHANGER?','Check out our Data Status tracker, accessible via the left-hand side menu. The “Documents” tab includes a filterable table of every policy or requirement within the GAMECHANGER corpus. The “Progress” and “Updates” tabs provide insight into the crawler ingestion status of each source within the corpus.','data'),
    ('How frequently is the GAMECHANGER corpus updated? How can I trust that the document I’m viewing is the most recent version?','Our automated crawlers typically run every 7 days. You can check the status of our crawlers at any time by navigating to the Data Status Tracker.','data'),
    ('Does the corpus include canceled or revoked documents?', 'Yes; to view outdated documents, users can select the “Status” filter to include canceled documents in their search results. Canceled documents will be outlined in red.', 'data'),
    ('Can GAMECHANGER help me track when and how policies have been updated?', 'Yes. Users can click on the star in the top right-hand corner of any document card to “favorite” the document. This will automatically add the policy to the user’s personalized user dashboard. Users can navigate to their own dashboard to easily monitor favorited policies for updates or to simply return to them without running a search. Keep an eye out for a future capability allowing users to sign up for alerts on favorited items (such as notifications when a favorited policy has been canceled or updated).', 'data'),

    
    ('What is the Responsibility Explorer?','The Responsibility Explorer extracts responsibilities stated within policy documents and assigns it to the entity responsible. Within the Responsibility Explorer, users can search for all responsibilities assigned to a particular entity (such as “Director, DIA”).','analyst tools'),
    ('How can I use the Responsibility Explorer?', 'Use the filters on the left to filter by document title, organization, or responsibility text to find related responsibilities identified in the GAMECHANGER corpus.<br/><br/>As an example, to find cyber related responsibilities specific to the DIA organization, type “DIA” in the <i>Organization</i> field and “cyber” in the <i>Responsibility Text</i> field. Click “Update Search”. The search will yield documents in the column on the left that include cyber related responsibilities specific to the DIA organization. Results are displayed in an accordion structure with documents at the topmost level, organizations/entities extracted in the level below, and responsibilities listed in the third level. Clicking on any responsibility will open the corresponding document in the same view to the page listing the corresponding responsibility.', 'analyst tools'),
    ('Does the Responsibility Explorer search against every policy in the corpus, or just a subset?', 'The Responsibility Explorer currently searches against a subset of policies in the corpus, to include DODD’s, DODI’s, and DODM’s. Check back in the near future to find more policies added to the tool.', 'analyst tools'),
    ('I found an incorrect result provided in the Responsibility Explorer. How can I notify the GAMECHANGER team?', 'Users can suggest edits through the tool itself. If the Responsibility Explorer provides an inaccurate result (e.g., the tool attributed a responsibility to the wrong entity), users can click to edit or reject the finding. All user suggestions submitted through the Responsibility Explorer are reviewed and approved by the GAMECHANGER team before any changes are made within the tool.  Please note that the Responsibility Explorer is seeking to extract accurate information from the policy documents, and user submitted data will need to conform with the text of the document.  Changing the data in the Responsibility Explore only changes what GAMECHANGER was able to extract and it DOES NOT change the underlying policy.', 'analyst tools'),
    ('What happened to the original view of the Responsibility Explorer?', 'Are you missing the old version look and feel? Users can still find and use the original table format of this tool by navigating to the top right corner of the tool under “View”. Select “Chart View” and the tool will revert to the original table format.', 'analyst tools'),
    ('What is the Document Comparison Tool? (Beta)', 'The Document Comparison Tool enables users to compare draft policy against existing policies. Users can easily conduct policy research by uploading text from a draft policy. The tool will quickly identify existing policies with similar text, enabling the user to quickly identify such concerns as: where policy conflicts may emerge, how similar or dissimilar the language is to existing policies, policies that may be impacted if the draft is authorized, organizations/agencies that might need to be notified before the draft is enacted, and more.', 'analyst tools'),
    ('How can I use the Document Comparison Tool?', 'Upload a sentence, paragraph, or string of paragraphs from a draft policy into the open text field of the tool and click submit. The tool will search for and yield the top existing policy documents within the GAMECHANGER corpus that share the most semantically similar text as determined by our Machine Learning models. Results are sorted by a similarity score. The higher the likelihood of a document’s relevancy is to a user’s search, the higher the document will appear in the list of results. Click “Quick Compare” to see a quick comparison between the input text and the result text, or select “Compare” to open the full document and compare the inputs within the full context of the document.', 'analyst tools'),
    ('What is “Similarity Score”?', 'The similarity in Document Comparison Tool is determined by a machine learning model and the similarity score corresponds to how confident the model is in a particular match.  Possible values for Similarity Score are: High, Medium and Low.  There is also a score of “No Match,” but those will not be displayed to the user.', 'analyst tools'),
    ('What do the “Thumbs Up” and “Thumbs Down” buttons do?', 'The “Thumbs Up” and “Thumbs Down” buttons are used to provide feedback to the GAMECHANGER team on how well the underlying machine learning model is performing.  A “Thumbs Up” indicates that a paragraph is a good match for a user’s use-case and a “Thumbs Down” indicates the paragraph is not a helpful match.', 'analyst tools'),
    ('Does the Document Comparison Tool search against every policy in the corpus, or just a subset?', 'Yes, the Document Comparison Tool searches against all policies available in the GAMECHANGER corpus.', 'analyst tools'),
    ('How do I share search queries or results with a colleague?','After running a search, click the “share” icon (right-pointing arrow) in the upper right-hand corner of the screen and a unique link will automatically be copied to a user’s clipboard. Users can then send unique links to a colleague who, by using the same link, can quickly run the same search, with any filters applied, and find the same results.','collaboration'),
    ('How do export my search results?','Click the export icon in the upper right-hand corner of the screen. Users have the option to choose among PDF, JSON, or CSV formats. Users wishing to export only a subset of results can first check the box on the top right corner of a single or set of document cards before clicking on the export icon.','collaboration');
