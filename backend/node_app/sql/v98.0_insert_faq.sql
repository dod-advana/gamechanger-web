    ('What is a GAMECHANGER clone?', 'GAMECHANGER technology is scalable and can be applied to use cases other than just policy. We refer to other “versions” of GAMECHANGER that are based on a different underlying corpus as clones. To date, we have 5 clones in production that are each focused on a specific use case. Our EDA clone, as an example, allows for search and discovery on DoD contract data. Clones can be customized and include features tailored to the particular use case.', 'clones'),
    ('How do I request a clone?', 'The first step would be to fill out our Clone Request form accessible via the left-hand side menu. The form requests information about your use case including use case background, data, expected users, permissions required, and any planned features. Once we receive your completed form, the GAMECHANGER team will review your use case and initiate follow-up discussions as needed to determine feasibility and Level of Effort.', 'clones'),
    ('What best practices should I keep in mind when constructing my search queries?','<b>Tip 1: <i>Start with basic keywords</i></b><br/>Start by running a simple search using keywords like <i>naval research</i>. Add other descriptive words or keywords to further narrow the results. You can also search using words or numbers that appear in the titles of documents, like <i>navy equal opportunity</i> or <i>opnavinst 5354</i>, which will bring the specific document to the top of the results.<br/><br/><b>Tip 2: <i>Use suggestions in the search bar</i></b><br/>GAMECHANGER allows real time searching across titles, topics, organizations, and more to help you search effectively before you even click enter. Typing <i>5500</i> suggests titles that contain the number to help you further narrow down your query. Or type <i>joint art</i> to see suggestions such as <i>joint artificial intelligence center</i> or <i>joint artificial</i>.<br/><br/><b>Tip 3: <i>Use filters in advanced or after searching on the side menu </i></b><br/>By clicking Advanced before running your first search, you can select specific sources, types of documents, publication dates, and more before you search. This can help narrow down documents when searching generic words. For example, searching for <i>Title 10</i> with the filter <b>Titles</b>, will give you the exact document. You can also add <b>Related Terms</b> (located in the side tab), which are terms that we think closely relate to your query.<br/><br/><b>Tip 4: <i>Use quotes</i></b><br/>Putting a query in quotes will give you an exact match, meaning you won''t get any stems and the phrase will be kept together. For example, if you search <i>environment protection</i> without quotes you may get results that have <i>environment</i> AND <i>protection</i> in the same paragraph, or even results that include <i>environmental protection</i>. Including quotes significantly reduces number of results you will get.<br/><br/><b>Tip 5: <i>Use operators </i></b><br/>GAMECHANGER uses default AND when you space words, so whether you type <i>electromagnetic operations</i> or <i>electromagnetic AND operations</i>, you will get the same results. You will see results that have both of those words in the document. You can use the operator <i>OR</i> like <i>electromagnetic OR operations</i>, which will give results that have either one or both words. You can also use the subtraction operator (-) to filter words that you do not want in the result. For example, <i>autonomous flight -naval</i> will remove results with the word naval in it. <br/><br/><b>Tip 6: <i>Use intelligent search and answers </i></b><br/>When you make a search, a prompt appears at the top of the results which is being retrieved using AI. You can search pronouns, entities, organizations, topics, and more. It can even be something you want a definition for. Searching <i>coast guard academy purpose</i> will give you the definition and purpose. You can also ask GAMECHANGER questions like <i>what is the mission of army corp of engineers?</i> <br/>', 'search'),
    ('Why are there some results that do not have highlights of my search term?', 'In a small number of cases, the highlights (or snippets) are cut off from being displayed on the front of the card but may still be contained in the document.', 'search'),
    ('Why is the prompt at the top unrelated to my search query?','The intelligent search uses AI to extract the most useful information from your search query.

    ('What is the Graph View and how do I use it?', 'Built on Neo4j, the Graph View visualizes complex relationships between documents by presenting nodes on a directed graph with edges. Each node represents a different document from the search results. Each edge represents a connection between documents. These connections are determined based upon references made within documents themselves. The Graph View is fully interactive and can be magnified to see more details. Clicking on a node provides a set of options to explore the document further, including an icon that opens the document card.','graph view'),
