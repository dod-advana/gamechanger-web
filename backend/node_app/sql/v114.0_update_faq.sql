SET answer = '<i><b>Tip 1: Start with basic keywords</i></b><br/>Start by running a simple search using keywords like <i>naval research</i>. Add other descriptive words or keywords to further narrow the results. You can also search using words or numbers that appear in the titles of documents, like <i>navy equal opportunity</i> or <i>opnavinst 5354</i>, which will bring the specific document to the top of the results.<br/><br/><b><i>Tip 2: Use suggestions in the search bar</i></b><br/>GAMECHANGER allows real time searching across titles, topics, organizations, and more to help you search effectively before you even click enter. Typing <i>5500</i> suggests titles that contain the number to help you further narrow down your query. Or type <i>joint art</i> to see suggestions such as <b>joint artificial intelligence center</b> or <b>joint artificial</b>.<br/><br/><i><b>Tip 3: Use filters in advanced or after searching on the side menu </i></b><br/>By clicking Advanced before running an initial search, users can select specific sources, types of documents, publication dates, and more to streamline results, particularly when searching generic words. For example, searching for <i>Title 10</i> with the filter <b>Titles</b>, will return the exact document. Users can also search <b>Related Terms</b> (located in the side tab), which are terms that may be similar to your query.<br/><br/><b><i>Tip 4: Use quotes</i></b></br>Putting a query in quotes will result in exact matches, meaning results will not include fragmented words or pieces of the query, but will search only and exactly on the entire query as-is. For example, a search on <i>environment protection</i> without quotes may yield results that have <b>environment</b> AND <b>protection</b> in the same paragraph, or even results that include <b>environmental protection</b>. Including quotes significantly reduces number of results provided.<br/><br/><b><i>Tip 5: Use operators</i></b></br>GAMECHANGER uses default <b>AND</b> when users include spaces between words, so whether <i>electromagnetic operations</i> or <i>electromagnetic</i> AND <i>operations</i> is searched, the application will yield the same results, all including both words in the documents provided. Users can use the operator <b>OR</b> like <i>electromagnetic OR operations</i>, which will yield results that have either one or both words. Users can also use the subtraction operator (-) to filter out words not wanted in the results. For example, <i>autonomous flight -naval</i> will remove results with the word naval in it.<br/><br/><b><i>Tip 6: Use intelligent search and answers</i></b></br>Many searches will yield a document or answer highlighted at the top of the results page, retrieved using AI through our Intelligent Search capability. This functionality is designed to help users more quickly identify specific documents, entities, organizations, and definitions, or even answer questions without searching through thousands of results. For example, searching <i>coast guard academy purpose</i> will yield the definition and purpose of the Coast Guard Academy; or, try asking GAMECHANGER a question, such as <i>what is the mission of army corps of engineers</i>?'
