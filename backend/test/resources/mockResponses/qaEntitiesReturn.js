President Richard Nixon proposed the establishment of EPA on July 9, 1970; it began operation on December 2, 1970, after Nixon signed an executive order. The order establishing the EPA was ratified by committee hearings in the House and Senate. The agency is led by its administrator, who is appointed by the president and approved by the Senate. The current Administrator is Michael S. Regan. The EPA is not a Cabinet department, but the administrator is normally given cabinet rank.The EPA has its headquarters in Washington, D.C., regional offices for each of the agency's ten regions, and 27 laboratories. The agency conducts environmental assessment, research, and education. It has the responsibility of maintaining and enforcing national standards under a variety of environmental laws, in consultation with state, tribal, and local governments. It delegates some permitting, monitoring, and enforcement responsibility to U.S. states and the federally recognized tribes. EPA enforcement powers include fines, sanctions, and other measures. The agency also works with industries and all levels of government in a wide variety of voluntary pollution prevention programs and energy conservation efforts.In 2018, the agency had 13,758 employees. More than half of EPA's employees are engineers, scientists, and environmental protection specialists; other employees include legal, public affairs, financial, and information technologists.Many public health and environmental groups advocate for the agency and believe that it is creating a better world. Other critics believe that the agency commits government overreach by adding unnecessary regulations on business and property owners.","information_source":"Wikipedia","information_retrieved":"2021-06-04"}},{"_index":"entities_20210624","_type":"_doc","_id":"-PAhP3oB3J4Grvsi5nS3","_score":13.812523,"_source":{"name":"Mission to the United Nations","website":"https://usun.usmission.gov/","address":"799 United Nations Plaza New York, NY 10017","government_branch":"Executive Department Sub-Office/Agency/Bureau","parent_agency":"United States Department of State","related_agency":"  ","entity_type":"org","crawlers":"","num_mentions":"","aliases":[{"name":"USUN"}],"information":"This is a list of United Nations peacekeeping missions since the United Nations was founded in 1945, organized by region, with the dates of deployment, the name of the related conflict, and the name of the UN operation.Peacekeeping, as defined by the United Nations, is a way to help countries torn by conflict create conditions for sustainable peace. UN peacekeepers—soldiers and military officers, police officers and civilian personnel from many countries—monitor and observe peace processes that emerge in post-conflict situations and assist ex-combatants in implementing the peace agreements they have signed. Such assistance comes in many forms, including confidence-building measures, power-sharing arrangements, electoral support, strengthening the rule of law, and economic and social development.The Charter of the United Nations gives the Security Council the power and responsibility to take collective action to maintain international peace and security. For this reason, the international community usually looks to the Security Council to authorize peacekeeping operations. Most of these operations are established and implemented by the United Nations itself with troops serving under UN operational command. In other cases, where direct UN involvement is not considered appropriate or feasible, the Council authorises regional organisations such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, the Economic Community of West African States or coalitions of willing countries to implement certain peacekeeping or peace enforcement functions.In modern times, peacekeeping operations have evolved into many different functions, including diplomatic relations with other countries, international bodies of justice (such as the International Criminal Court), and eliminating problems such as landmines that can lead to new incidents of fighting.","information_source":"Wikipedia","information_retrieved":"2021-06-04"}},{"_index":"entities_20210624","_type":"_doc","_id":"jqUhP3oBFfTl1EkW5h5t","_score":9.269005,"_source":{"name":"Pentagon Force Protection Agency","website":"https://www.pfpa.mil/","address":"  ","government_branch":"Executive Department Sub-Office/Agency/Bureau","parent_agency":"United States Department of Defense","related_agency":"  ","entity_type":"org","crawlers":"","num_mentions":"","aliases":[{"name":"PFPA"}],"information":"The Pentagon Force Protection Agency (PFPA) is a federal law enforcement agency within the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) charged with protecting and safeguarding the occupants, visitors, and infrastructure of The Pentagon, the Mark Center Building, the Defense Health Agency headquarters, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces and other assigned DoD-occupied leased facilities within the National Capitol Region.
